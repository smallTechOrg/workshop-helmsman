const FAQS: { q: string; a: React.ReactNode }[] = [
  {
    q: "Do I need an account?",
    a: (
      <>
        No. There is no signup, no password and no login anywhere in Workshop
        Helmsman. When you create a workshop you are given a private facilitator
        link — <strong>that link is the credential</strong>. Anyone holding it can run
        that workshop; anyone without it cannot see it.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "What happens if I lose my dashboard link?",
    a: (
      <>
        You lose your way back in. There is no account to recover and no password
        reset, so <strong>save the dashboard link the moment it is shown to you</strong> —
        bookmark it, paste it into your notes, mail it to yourself. The reveal screen
        gives you a copy button and says the same thing.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Then what is the “Your workshops” list?",
    a: (
      <>
        A convenience, not an account. Your browser remembers the workshops you made
        here so you can jump back in from this page. Clear your browser data, switch
        browsers or use a private window and the list is gone — the workshop itself is
        untouched and still reachable at its link.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "What do participants need?",
    a: (
      <>
        A browser and the join link. Nothing to install, no account, no extension.
        It works on a laptop or a phone, and their progress survives a refresh, a
        closed tab or a move to another device via their personal link.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Is it really free? Where does my data live?",
    a: (
      <>
        Yes — Workshop Helmsman is free and open, and it is self-hosted: the workshop
        data lives in this instance's own database, on the machine serving this page.
        No third party gets your participants' names.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "Why do you ask for my email at the end?",
    a: (
      <>
        Purely so the person running this instance can contact you about your
        workshop if they have to, and as a light deterrent against abuse.{" "}
        <strong>No mail is ever sent to you</strong> — not a confirmation, not a
        newsletter — and it is never shared. Your dashboard link is shown on screen,
        not mailed.
      </>
    ),
  },
  {
    q: "How many people can join one workshop?",
    a: (
      <>
        It is built and tested for rooms of 300+ concurrent participants on modest
        hardware. A typical lab of 20–60 will not make it break a sweat.
